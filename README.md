# Inject Challenge

The Inject challenge was the second weekend challenge at Makers Academy.

We were briefed that we had to rewrite the inject method, (assuming a block is always given).

## Objectives

To understand how the inject method works.

## Technology
- Ruby
- Rspec

### To Run
```
$ git clone https://github.com/katebeavis/inject-challenge.git
$ cd inject-challenge
$ irb
    > Dir['./lib/*.rb'].each {|file| require file }
```

### To Run Tests
```
$ rspec
```
